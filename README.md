# üç¥ Food-Share
An app that allows restaurants to give away their leftovers for free/at a discounted price to users
This app was built using glide apps, which uses google sheets to construct apps.

## üìï Description of Problem and Solution
- Food waste is a big problem. Many restaurants throw away edible food at the end of the day because it can't be sold.
- However, I attempted to make an app to reduce this problem of food waste and insecurity
- The app allows restaurants to give away food at a discounted price or for free to people who are willing to come and pick it up as soon as possible. This also means restaurants can potentialy increase their revenues by selling food that would have otherwise gone to waste

## üëá Installation
1. You can open the app in either your browser, or install it on a phone
2. Go on [this link](https://glorious-middle-3519.glideapp.io/) to visit the app on the browser. It should display an iPhone screen, you may need to zoom out if the proportions of the app aren't fitting to the screen
3. To install the app on your phone, scan the qr code which will open the app on the phone browser. If you're using iOS, visit the app link on **safari**, click share and add to home screen. On android, click the install button in the top right of the browser and it should install the app to your home screen
4. You can now open and play around with the app. The app is just a prototype for a possible app, so the users on the app are just dummy accounts. 
5. **IMPORTANT: If you want to see the inner workings of the app, send me an email (ssifa70423(at)kes.edu.kw) and I will add you as a member of the project so you can view and edit a copy of the apps workings**

## üìù Features & Demo

Feel free to follow along by viewing the app in the browser, or installing it on your phone

### **The Food tab allows you to look at the food that restaurants are offering nearby. You can click on a card to get more details like the price and location to pick up**

### **2. The map tab allows you to find restaurants offering unsold food nearby on the map. When you click on the restaurant, you are bought to a tab where you can view the details of the food provided and you can place the order to go and get the food**

### **3. When you place an order of food, you can go to the cart tab to view your order. I am still currently working on a payment process that I couldn't finish in a short time. Right now, you can call the restaurant to verify the order until I can place a proper payment feature**

## üìí Notes
- This was a hackathon project, it is not 100% complete and ready for deploying as I did not have enough time to, but I will be sure to add more features and work on improving and hopefully deploying this app in the future.
- I still need to work on a payment method, a way for restaurants to sign up and give away their food
- Contributers to the project are welcome if you have feature requests or issues, create an issue
- Before creating this app, I knew almost nothing about app development, so it's safe to say I've learned a lot this weekend. Learning new ways to make apps have opened up myself to so many new project that I could not have otherwise created.
- Creating a fully fledged app in 24 Hours would not have been possible if I didn't use glide apps, especially not alone. It makes making an app much faster and easier, so I could focus more time on the actual idea and solution.
